       "966     As advertised, a very authentic NYC midtown apartment that was very close to the theatre district. Randi was excellent with communication. I was traveling alone with my 17yr old daughter so safety was a big concern. Randi's apartment is on a safe street, and has a lock on main front door of building, another into her apt, and yet another into our private room. We felt very safe. The bed was comfortable and there were two very soft robes for use. We would definitely recommend and will return ...   \n",

       "10450   In English :  We loved our stay at Jack's appartment. It is well located, just 5 minutes walk to the subway. Lots of stores and restaurants next to it.  Jack is very very quick to answer and we had no problem to communicate with him, even during our stay when we had questions. He was very kind with us. The appartment itself is almost the same as on the pictures. It is clean. The bed is very comfortable !  The only thing I have to say is the appartment is a little noisy, especially at night, ...   \n",
