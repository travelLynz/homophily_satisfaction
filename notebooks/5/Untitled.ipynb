I pride myself on this actually. The tenants came to the apt obviously \"partying\" for a music festival as they states and trashed the place.  I immediately called Airbnb after addressing this with the tenants asking them to take care of this situation. This is not a hotel with a cleaning service. As well as it clearly states that this is a shared apt.    This is NOT a hotel. I am not surprised that these young women didn't like the fact that I asked them accountable for their actions and simply clean up after themselves. The fact that the vacuum was such a tremendous road block to not clean up after themselves just is an example of the entitled behavior of these young women. I still have glitter in the living room and bathroom 3 weeks later.  This is unacceptable.    I am a Brazilian student living in ... (unimaginable? exciting? stressful? contagious? ...) New York City. It is very difficult to define an adjective that fits perfectly with what I feel for this city. every day is a new experience, new feelings, new discoveries, and I think I will never have an only adjective to express what I feel for New York. I was born and raised in Porto Alegre, a city in Southern Brazil. At 19, I moved to Rio de Janeiro, my city in the world. Since child I always wanted to live in Rio de Janeiro, always loved the ocean, to be near this. And I live  that in Rio de Janeiro. Go to the beach after work, go bathe in the ocean at night after class .. The Rio de Janeiro is a city that makes you feel alive, gives you energy, makes you cry with emotion when you see the natural beauty it has. I never thought of moving from Rio de Janeiro, and even today I know it's my place, but I was 27, and felt a need to live new exeperiencia, seeing different places, different cultures, and I changed my whole life and I came to the Big Apple. The life here is not easy, it is very hard you get your space, it is very hard you leave the margins of society, you enter in the \"system\" of the city, but each day of fighting is rewarding. At 1 year and 7 months that I live in NYC, I've seen many people pass through the city, stay a while, but 99% of people don't stand the pressure which is living, or rather survive here. And I think the phrase that defines New York City is: \"It is not you who chooses New York, It  is New York that chooses you.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>I have been home-sharing for about 10 years now and have met many interesting people. I view visitors more as short-term roommates than I do as guests.  Home-sharing truly has been a blessing for me. It's helped me to pay the rent and still given me the flexibility to have the place all to my own when I'd like to do so. That's a huge benefit!  As a guest, I have used Airbnb to travel to Tokyo and spent a few weekends staying at a farmhouse outside New York City. We watched films on the side of a barnhouse. Very cool!  I am a relatively easy-going guy. I drink socially and do not smoke or use drugs. I definitely like to have fun, especially if it involves doing something new and it doesn't cost a ton of money. I love deals!  While I tend to be easy-going, I do have my pet-peeves. For example, a shoes-free home means just that. With that said, I ask that you please review the house \"rules\" before you book with me.  Either as a host or a guest, I'd be up for hanging out some time. I like to meet new people and explore the city together. If you'd like to hang out during your visit, then let me know in advance. My work schedule is pretty unpredictable and I often do work from home. I can get pretty busy, but if you give me some advance notice I'll make sure we have time to spend together. Otherwise, I generally assume that guests want independence.  If you prefer to do your own thing, then that's totally fine too. Don't worry I won't be offended. I can certainly appreciate that you may have a pretty full itinerary when you come to NYC.  I'm a former journalist, PR guy and worked for a non-profit in the sustainable agriculture / environmental field for many years. I started my own coaching/consulting business a few years ago and would be interested to find out more about what's going on in your life. Perhaps I can help you out in some way?  My guests have included a combination of tourists and business travelers. Whichever category you fall under, you're welcome to stay with me. I have an extra room and I'd be happy to provide you with an opportunity to step into the shoes of a New York City resident for a while. Who knows? Maybe you'll like the East Village so much that you'll want to find your own apartment and never want to leave.  I host singles and couples, but you should note that there is an added fee of $30 per night for all additional guests over one person.  The most common things I hear from guests are:  \"The room is so much bigger than I thought based on the photos in your listing,\"  \"This is a really cool room/place!\"  \"I love the natural light that comes into this room!\"  \"It's such a comfy atmosphere in here that I really hate to leave!\"  Guests really love the location! location! location!  On the flip side, I sometimes hear people remark that walking up five flights is \"telling them that they need to get into better shape.\"  If nothing else, I hope that you'll find your visit with me to be enlightening (that's a joke because the bedroom is well-lit and I am a life coach ;)  Look forward to meeting you!</td>\n",

Some of my favorite destinations are Tokyo, Los Angeles, Miami, Paris, Venice, and the Caribbean.  Places I hope to visit soon are South Africa, Bora Bora, and Greece.    I moved into my studio apartment 7 years ago and absolutely LOVE it!  Finding a great place to live in New York City can be a challenge but I lucked out with this little gem.   Friends sometimes call me OCD because I am very particular about my space.  This is a good thing for guests because it means you'll enjoy a clean and tidy space.    I am a happy well-balanced person that loves to learn, travel and share. I look forward to hosting your next adventure.</td>\n",

I like simple  things in life but with quality. I really  love love New York,  my  family and friends of course.  I like to be neat and clean, enjoy traveling, as well, all over the world. Once I heard this  phrase: \"the eyes  have  to travel\", and I apply it  to learn and fulfill the spirit  visiting new places and meeting  interesting people.  When I am not exploring New York City or hanging out  with my  friends I prefer stay  relaxing at home or working in my art works, and   I put time beside to walk through galleries and museums in the city, there is a lot  to see and enjoy in this amazing, incredible place.

I'm well-travelled, respectful of people's space and homes (seriously, I will treat it as if it were my own) and love meeting new people.  I travel incessantly, am easy to get along with, and can share loads of information with you on things to do and places to go in NYC.  I live on the UES in a beautiful one-bedroom apt a mere 2 1/2 blocks from Central Park and within minutes of the Met, Guggenheim, and Jewish  museums. This ultra-quiet apt is light-filled (7 windows) and more quiet then you can imagine.   I greet all my guests and give them a personal tour of the apt. Also provided are high quality towels and bedding.  My glass is always half-full and never half empty. I view the world as a friendly place.   \n",

Now I'm not working in an corporate/government environment - have taken early retirement from the school system and am plotting the next segment of my life.  In the interim,  I love having fun, interesting people around.   \n",

As a frequent traveler, I understand how important it is to have a home base in a foreign city that is clean, safe, comfortable, conveniently located, and affordable. I also appreciate having a home base that is a real home -- not a generic hotel room or crowded hostel. I will do my absolute best to make sure that my guests feel right at home in the Big Apple.   \n",

I've been living in NYC for 10 years.  But I like to travel.  I am happy to recco the \"best of\" everything from movieplexes to the secret burger spots.  I hope to one day rent a sailboat, or igloo.  :)   \n",

I'm Jay and I work in community planning for New York City. My wife and I travel quite a bit and love being able to use Airbnb to connect to a city in such a cool way. Our style of traveling is to get up early, walk everywhere, take tours, go see as much art and culture as we can and generally be dead tired by the time we get back to the place at night. We are currently on a mission to eat every possible food we can.   \n",

I work for an Italian wine importer, and my wife is a writer (Manifesta, Grassroots, Opting In) and founder of Soapbox, a lecture agency. Because of my work, we eat out quite frequently and are well versed with the city's restaurant scene. We are an athletic family (basketball, soccer, baseball, running) and frequently can be seen on our bikes, exploring new places in and around the city. We love to travel (Costa Rica, Sun Valley, Pacific Northwest, Italy in particular), and to be active outdoors. In fact, we like to spend as little time indoors as possible! But when we are home, there's nothing wrong with a good jigsaw puzzle or game of backgammon by candlelight. Hope you enjoy our place!   \n",

Working in the television/entertainment industry, I travel often for work and would love to share my great apartment with visitors of my favorite city.   My neighborhood, Hells Kitchen, cannot be beat. Close to Times Square but with a personality all its own, it's a part of the city everyone should experience. My apartment conveniently located on the first floor is easy to access and perfect for dropping in and out during your stay.  If you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to email me!   \n",

I love to read and write, I grew up in the '90s in eastern europe, so I still have that in me :)  I travel often and randomly, so my studio is usually only available when I have to travel for work, but I can also stay with my family and friends, if my dates don't work out with yours, so do contact me for any dates, also I can refer you to my friends who are members on airbnb as well.  And, my rates vary depending on the time of the year!   Please contact me if you have any more questions.  Thank You, and hope you get to enjoy this great city!   \n",

I create ad campaigns for a living, but I live to travel. My partner Bazi is a painter and designer.   We've booked with Airbnb throughout the world and decided to become hosts to return the favor.  My favorite city:  Istanbul My most recent trip: Myanmar Food I can't live without:  Soup dumplings (xiao long bao)  I love helping guests plan the perfect meal -- from that hard to find taco truck in Queens to scoring reservations at Momofuku Ko.   If it's tasty in NYC, chances are I know about it.   \n",

I work in Fashion in the city, I have a busy schedule and am rarely home. I spend most of my free time in the Soho/Nolita area and am always happy to share good addresses for shopping, restaurant and nightlife.   \n",

I also spent my summers at my family's Jersey Shore house.  I love traveling and seeing the world, and have been very fortunate to have the opportunity to do so.  My favorite place I have been so far is Ascona, Switzerland on Lago Maggiore.  It's a beautiful little town on the Swiss/Italian border and has just the right amount of Italian \"la dolce vita\" paired with Swiss precision. I hope to go back to their annual Jazz Festival.   I have lived in the New York City area for 10 years now, so I am able to recommend places to visit during your stay and I think you will find my City Guide very helpful when getting to know the West Village neighborhood and its many shops and restaurants.  Being in real estate and having worked on many projects on different neighborhoods, I know my way around the city very well and able to provide directions for you if you need help getting around.    I have rented out my apartment to members of the Airbnb community and have had nothing but great experiences.  Feel free to read my reviews and ask questions.   My apartment is so cozy and comfortable and I think members of the Airbnb community will very much enjoy their stay.  It is in the BEST location in NYC. It's very quiet and I wake up to birds singing every single morning! I am also very neat and clean and would love for my guests to be the same.   I travel quite often so feel free to let me know in advance if you are interested in the apartment for a future date.   \n",

Forever a fan of New York! Thirty-something year old attorney living and working in New York. I travel as much as I can and like to rent out my studio while I am away to help cover my rent.   My home is cute and cozy. It's nicely decorated with items from my travels. A mix of antiques, mid century modern and rustic (I'm Canadian after all...)  Linens and towels are provided. Feel free to use my small but fully equipped kitchen!  I only rent out my home when I am away on vacation. I'm also interested in swapping apartments so get in touch!   \n",

I pride myself on this actually. The tenants came to the apt obviously \"partying\" for a music festival as they states and trashed the place.  I immediately called Airbnb after addressing this with the tenants asking them to take care of this situation. This is not a hotel with a cleaning service. As well as it clearly states that this is a shared apt.    This is NOT a hotel. I am not surprised that these young women didn't like the fact that I asked them accountable for their actions and simply clean up after themselves. The fact that the vacuum was such a tremendous road block to not clean up after themselves just is an example of the entitled behavior of these young women. I still have glitter in the living room and bathroom 3 weeks later.  This is unacceptable.    I am a Brazilian student living in ... (unimaginable? exciting? stressful? contagious? ...) New York City. It is very difficult to define an adjective that fits perfectly with what I feel for this city. every day is a new experience, new feelings, new discoveries, and I think I will never have an only adjective to express what I feel for New York. I was born and raised in Porto Alegre, a city in Southern Brazil. At 19, I moved to Rio de Janeiro, my city in the world. Since child I always wanted to live in Rio de Janeiro, always loved the ocean, to be near this. And I live  that in Rio de Janeiro. Go to the beach after work, go bathe in the ocean at night after class .. The Rio de Janeiro is a city that makes you feel alive, gives you energy, makes you cry with emotion when you see the natural beauty it has. I never thought of moving from Rio de Janeiro, and even today I know it's my place, but I was 27, and felt a need to live new exeperiencia, seeing different places, different cultures, and I changed my whole life and I came to the Big Apple. The life here is not easy, it is very hard you get your space, it is very hard you leave the margins of society, you enter in the \"system\" of the city, but each day of fighting is rewarding. At 1 year and 7 months that I live in NYC, I've seen many people pass through the city, stay a while, but 99% of people don't stand the pressure which is living, or rather survive here. And I think the phrase that defines New York City is: \"It is not you who chooses New York, It  is New York that chooses you.\"   \n",
       "251  I have been home-sharing for about 10 years now and have met many interesting people. I view visitors more as short-term roommates than I do as guests.  Home-sharing truly has been a blessing for me. It's helped me to pay the rent and still given me the flexibility to have the place all to my own when I'd like to do so. That's a huge benefit!  As a guest, I have used Airbnb to travel to Tokyo and spent a few weekends staying at a farmhouse outside New York City. We watched films on the side of a barnhouse. Very cool!  I am a relatively easy-going guy. I drink socially and do not smoke or use drugs. I definitely like to have fun, especially if it involves doing something new and it doesn't cost a ton of money. I love deals!  While I tend to be easy-going, I do have my pet-peeves. For example, a shoes-free home means just that. With that said, I ask that you please review the house \"rules\" before you book with me.  Either as a host or a guest, I'd be up for hanging out some time. I like to meet new people and explore the city together. If you'd like to hang out during your visit, then let me know in advance. My work schedule is pretty unpredictable and I often do work from home. I can get pretty busy, but if you give me some advance notice I'll make sure we have time to spend together. Otherwise, I generally assume that guests want independence.  If you prefer to do your own thing, then that's totally fine too. Don't worry I won't be offended. I can certainly appreciate that you may have a pretty full itinerary when you come to NYC.  I'm a former journalist, PR guy and worked for a non-profit in the sustainable agriculture / environmental field for many years. I started my own coaching/consulting business a few years ago and would be interested to find out more about what's going on in your life. Perhaps I can help you out in some way?  My guests have included a combination of tourists and business travelers. Whichever category you fall under, you're welcome to stay with me. I have an extra room and I'd be happy to provide you with an opportunity to step into the shoes of a New York City resident for a while. Who knows? Maybe you'll like the East Village so much that you'll want to find your own apartment and never want to leave.  I host singles and couples, but you should note that there is an added fee of $30 per night for all additional guests over one person.  The most common things I hear from guests are:  \"The room is so much bigger than I thought based on the photos in your listing,\"  \"This is a really cool room/place!\"  \"I love the natural light that comes into this room!\"  \"It's such a comfy atmosphere in here that I really hate to leave!\"  Guests really love the location! location! location!  On the flip side, I sometimes hear people remark that walking up five flights is \"telling them that they need to get into better shape.\"  If nothing else, I hope that you'll find your visit with me to be enlightening (that's a joke because the bedroom is well-lit and I am a life coach ;)  Look forward to meeting you!   \n",

We really take pride in our little piece of Manhattan outdoor paradise.   Our friends are my family and extremely important to us. This building is also where we met 3 of of our closest friends who all still live in the building!   We also believe in the little things.

We are young professionals working in fashion with a knack for hosting. We are foodies and love to recommend many unique places to eat, see and go out. We love to share all the \"local spots\" and give you an experience you would not get through a hotel. Hosting guests/friends from all over the world has been a great experience and we always enjoy sharing our home with our guests.   \n",

In my spare time I enjoy cooking healthy food, tasting new wines, watching movies on Netflix, spending time with my dog, and traveling.  Some of my favorite destinations are Tokyo, Los Angeles, Miami, Paris, Venice, and the Caribbean.  Places I hope to visit soon are South Africa, Bora Bora, and Greece.    I moved into my studio apartment 7 years ago and absolutely LOVE it!  Finding a great place to live in New York City can be a challenge but I lucked out with this little gem.   Friends sometimes call me OCD because I am very particular about my space.  This is a good thing for guests because it means you'll enjoy a clean and tidy space.    I am a happy well-balanced person that loves to learn, travel and share. I look forward to hosting your next adventure.   \n",
