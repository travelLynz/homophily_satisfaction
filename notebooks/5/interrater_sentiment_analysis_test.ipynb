       "114008  Me and my party have mixed feelings on our stay with Noa. I'll start with the positives: Noa is a great host. He gave us a warm welcome and a nice intro. to the area, transport etc. He even contacted me mid-stay with more suggestions on what to do. Noa also provided 2 sets of keys and was very flexible with check out times - much appreciated! We were provided with clean bedding and towels upon arrival and the fridge was stocked with a few complimentary drinks. The location of the flat is fantastic. A 1 minute walk to the bus stops (in and out of downtown) and a 4 minute walk to the subway....   \n",
       "115123  Ari was awesome we were so fortunate to book his place last minute in NYC on New Years eve! My partner and I had booked a different airbnb for the evening previously but unfortunately the host had a change of plans and had to cancel on us. In a mad scramble I found Ari's place and it was everything we could have hoped for and more.   The apartment itself was clean, modern and warm, huge by New York standards. We only met Ari for a minute on his way out, he handed us the keys and gave us a quick overview.  While we were out for most of the day and evening, when we got back the apartment bui...   \n",
       "163454  Catia's small studio is lovely, well-decorated and she's done a great job organizing it, which is important since it's a small space. It was fine for two of us (my wife and I). The only slight issue is that there's really not much of a place to put clothing that doesn't hang -- we had to use the couch for that purpose. She has a well-functioning kitchen and a Nespresso machine and milk steamer which quickly makes nice shots. The small stove works nicely. The location is convenient, just a couple of blocks from Penn Station with easy access to subway lines. She has TV and a Roku box so when...   \n",

A very kind and hospitable man. We stayed there for four nights and didn't see him and his wife much during our stay because we were in town most of the time. The apartment was okay, but not very clean. The dog was well-behaved and playful, but his hairs were all-over. The location is very good! Nice safe neighborhood, lots of restaurants nearby, super close to the subway and 2 blocks to central park. The price was decent as well.   \n",

       "114008  Me and my party have mixed feelings on our stay with Noa. I'll start with the positives: Noa is a great host. He gave us a warm welcome and a nice intro. to the area, transport etc. He even contacted me mid-stay with more suggestions on what to do. Noa also provided 2 sets of keys and was very flexible with check out times - much appreciated! We were provided with clean bedding and towels upon arrival and the fridge was stocked with a few complimentary drinks. The location of the flat is fantastic.

       "115123  Ari was awesome we were so fortunate to book his place last minute in NYC on New Years eve! My partner and I had booked a different airbnb for the evening previously but unfortunately the host had a change of plans and had to cancel on us. In a mad scramble I found Ari's place and it was everything we could have hoped for and more.   The apartment itself was clean, modern and warm, huge by New York standards. We only met Ari for a minute on his way out, he handed us the keys and gave us a quick overview.  While we were out for most of the day and evening, when we got back the apartment bui...   \n",
       "163454  Catia's small studio is lovely, well-decorated and she's done a great job organizing it, which is important since it's a small space. It was fine for two of us (my wife and I). The only slight issue is that there's really not much of a place to put clothing that doesn't hang -- we had to use the couch for that purpose. She has a well-functioning kitchen and a Nespresso machine and milk steamer which quickly makes nice shots. The small stove works nicely. The location is convenient, just a couple of blocks from Penn Station with easy access to subway lines. She has TV and a Roku box so when...   \n",

A very kind and hospitable man. We stayed there for four nights and didn't see him and his wife much during our stay because we were in town most of the time. The apartment was okay, but not very clean. The dog was well-behaved and playful, but his hairs were all-over. The location is very good! Nice safe neighborhood, lots of restaurants nearby, super close to the subway and 2 blocks to central park. The price was decent as well.   \n",

       "23431   The room was a good size. However it didn't seem that the sheets were clean since I found long female hair in the bed. Also I had an evening appointment and Susan told me that she lost her extra key so she couldn't provide me with my own key. And she would like me to not come home too late since she would have to wait up for me to return so she could let me into the building and the apartment. And if I wanted to come home after 11 pm she wanted me to call her to let her know. And she would prefer that I didn't come home later than 12. It really felt like a curfew and it was annoying since ...   \n",
       "114008  Me and my party have mixed feelings on our stay with Noa. I'll start with the positives: Noa is a great host. He gave us a warm welcome and a nice intro. to the area, transport etc. He even contacted me mid-stay with more suggestions on what to do. Noa also provided 2 sets of keys and was very flexible with check out times - much appreciated! We were provided with clean bedding and towels upon arrival and the fridge was stocked with a few complimentary drinks. The location of the flat is fantastic. A 1 minute walk to the bus stops (in and out of downtown) and a 4 minute walk to the subway....   \n",

My partner and I had booked a different airbnb for the evening previously but unfortunately the host had a change of plans and had to cancel on us. In a mad scramble I found Ari's place and it was everything we could have hoped for and more.   The apartment itself was clean, modern and warm, huge by New York standards. We only met Ari for a minute on his way out, he handed us the keys and gave us a quick overview.  While we were out for most of the day and evening, when we got back the apartment bui...   \n",
       "163454  Catia's small studio is lovely, well-decorated and she's done a great job organizing it, which is important since it's a small space. It was fine for two of us (my wife and I). The only slight issue is that there's really not much of a place to put clothing that doesn't hang -- we had to use the couch for that purpose. She has a well-functioning kitchen and a Nespresso machine and milk steamer which quickly makes nice shots. The small stove works nicely. The location is convenient, just a couple of blocks from Penn Station with easy access to subway lines. She has TV and a Roku box so when...   \n",

A very kind and hospitable man. We stayed there for four nights and didn't see him and his wife much during our stay because we were in town most of the time. The apartment was okay, but not very clean. The dog was well-behaved and playful, but his hairs were all-over. The location is very good! Nice safe neighborhood, lots of restaurants nearby, super close to the subway and 2 blocks to central park. The price was decent as well.   \n",
       "176985  We had a great stay. Everything was as expected and the townhouse was even much bigger than we anticipated given he typically small NYC apartments. It was amazing to stay in a traditional New York brownstone. There were 4 floors total in the townhouse. 2 twin beds in a room and a queen bed in a room on each of the two upper floors. Each of the two upper floors had a bathroom. The main floor had  a living room and large open kitchen. The basement had a large TV in the living area and the third bathroom.

She gave great advice on places to eat, where to and not to go, transportation, and even fun things to do in the city.

It was late to request a refund.  Squeaky beds, hard to sleep with so much noise. One of the mattress had a hole. Shower walls with mold and tub needed a little scrub.

It had a lot of amenities and everything you could ask for. The bed was great by the way. We absolutely loved the aroma diffuser!!!! Con: the drawers of the dresser were all broken and missing some bolts so we had to use super glue to fix it (we couldn’t even left our clothes there because it was literally falling apart).

My flight was delayed for one day due to snowstorm and Casper was very responsive on coordinating getting in and out of the apartment for me. Everything was clean and Casper was nice enough to refund half of the first missing day for me because of the flight delay! The only thing you have to be aware of is the 4 flights of stairs walking up to the apartment. We had two girls going shopping everyday with handful of bags so we definitely got a great workout climbing up. =P   \n",

I think the murphy bed is a little more comfy than the queen bed, but both are nice.  Stairs are narrow, but typical for older apartments.

       "9028    What a location. Its 5 mins walk to the 2 Av subway station, 10-12 mins walk to Soho and 5 mins walk to Chinatown. This is really ideal if you want to experience the city by day. Reina was very helpful in helping me and I wish I could have known her better due to my busy schedule. She's also very quick with response time, I almost had a panic attack in which I thought I couldn't make it to my booking but she was more than helpful and even advised me on options.   All in all, I had a great 14 days with this stay and I would recommend this place to others especially if you want to be part of...   \n",
       "134693  We had a nice stay in the apartment which is great located close to the highline, times square and Penn station. The apartment it self was clean and functional. The apartment was painted in some quite dark colors which we did not find super cozy. However I guess this is just a matter of preference, so some may find this very nice. The host was very flexible regarding our check-in/check out time and supplied us with some info about the local area such as grocery stores, restuarant, etc. which was nice. All in all we can not complain. We had a nice stay and the apartment was pretty much as e...   \n",
       "237619  We were the lucky first occupants of this lovely, spacious, clean and well situated apartment. John greeted us himself and we were very pleasantly surprised - the photos on Airbnb do not do justice to this two bedroom apartment that is only 5 mins from Times Square and 2 mins from Restaurant Row.  The building looks recently renovated and our ground floor apartment certainly was. Large, airy rooms that are spotlessly clean and well equipped with a full kitchen and bathroom complete with bath tub/shower over. The spacious master bedroom is very light, it has three sets of windows and the se...   \n",
       "163161            I got the run around on finding the key and being let into the unit. The host was out of the country, the person she left in charge also ended up being out of the country. The person she left in charge gave the key to a friend who was suppose to leave it for us in a pizza shop. The key never made and we were stuck out in the cold, in Harlem (the non-gentrified side), at 10 pm. We didn't get into the unit for an hour and a half when finally the host called the janitor of the building to let us in. Was my experience an anomaly? Perhaps, but I definitely wouldn't use this person again.   \n",

We really enjoyed our stay at David’s place. The location is good, not too central - the noise is big issue, but close to most places you want to go. David has provided almost everything you’ll need during your stay, if not the 24hr store is just 2mins walk away.  The only concern would be no air con, we had a few wet but hot days. Made it hard to fall asleep and very humid too.  Overall was a great host. Will highly recommend!   \n",

Lee was super kind and very helpful , offered help and was responsive right away.  The location of his apartment is FANTASTIC and the apartment itself was very clean and extremely comfortable.  It was truly a pleasure staying there.  Thank you so much Lee for making our trip to NYC unforgettable.  I will not even look into hotels next time we wanna go to NYC.  I will look for your apartment again.  Thanks! You are an A+ host!!!   \n",

New York was very hot at the moment, and the AC functioned. The apartment was spacious. Our two teenagers could very well stay in the smallest bedroom. The apartment is in the 5.floor and had a lot of light. It is charming and reminded me of my student days though a bit more comfortable. The kitchen was ok.

Although the location lived up to its expectation (nice neighborhood with plenty of new trendy shops/restaurants), and the apartment was actually more spacious than we imagined, there were many things that made the experience unpleasant. -We arrived at check-in on time and had to wait more than two hours to get the keys, while they kept telling us it would be just 10 more minutes... - On arriving into the apartment, we smelled some gas, which turns out was leaking from the gas stove.

It would have been nice to have some closet or drawer space to store our stuff while there, as it can get crowded. The cat Gretchen moved between moments of friendliness and (weird) aggression.

The place is close to the subway system, near bars & restaurants. On the downside, the shower wasn't fully functional and the kitchen sink was not working properly.  I know it is NY and you can't escape the noise, but the location was pretty noisy compared to another place we stayed at on 19th street.

We were met by a maid who just handed us the keys and didn't explain anything about the apt. The apt was very clean but lacked amenities such as soap in the shower & shampoo. Since it is on the 1st floor and close to the street it is quite noisy due to the restaurants & bars downstairs. The sofa bed is very uncomfortable There was no possible way to extend check out time as Alessandro booked another guest the same day we were leaving.

The location is perfect: food, grocery, subway, sites - everything is very close. The apartment in very small, but there is enough space for a couple and you will probably spend most of your time out. Sometimes it gets noisy and you may hear neighbors from upstairs walking in their apartment or main door opening/closing. However it is not that bad and I would definitely recommend this place to stay. Everything went smoothly with Leonardo, he is a great host.   \n",

But as much as I want to give her a five star review I just cannot.  At first sight the apartment looks very clean, but it's actually just cleaned superficially. It looks clean but touching it makes you realize it is not as clean as you might have thought. They underside of the toilet seat was not cleaned at all, it was not white.

Also the toilet didn't flesh properly. All one wants in accommodation is usually cleanliness and for things to work. Wifi didn't work but that is likely the ISP not the accommodation itself.

Large, airy rooms that are spotlessly clean and well equipped with a full kitchen and bathroom complete with bath tub/shower over.

The key never made and we were stuck out in the cold, in Harlem (the non-gentrified side), at 10 pm.

All the basics were there.  Location is perfect.  He was very kind, quick with responses, left snacks for us, gave us recommendations.  The bedding was very comfortable. There was a closet for hanging clothes and a table with 2 drawers for storage.  The room decoration was just like the picture. The bathroom was very clean and had a tub w/shower head.

However, this part made the whole trip feel much smoother. His place is clean, the bathroom is large, the neighborhood is quiet, I felt safe, it was close to a major subway line, and Fabien is very nice and really hospitable.

The key never made and we were stuck out in the cold, in Harlem (the non-gentrified side), at 10 pm.

The place is also very noisy and poorly insulated, which means on a hot day the aircon is not effective at all. This place maybe okay value by NY \"standards\" but otherwise not great at all. All NY accommodation is an utter ripoff.   \n",
       "341072  I don't know how this unit is getting great reviews, but we found it HORRENDOUS. I have stayed in Air B and B's in large cities... Never in NY, so maybe NYC sets a pretty low bar. But this was awful. First of all, it's been represented as family friendly. The bathroom lock was broken. There was some crap on the shower curtain. There were partially used bottles of mouthwash, deodorant sticks, and get this... KY Jelly, in the bathroom. The kitchen had partially eaten food in the fridge. The towels had stains on them. The old world window AC's were so noisy that my 5 year old couldn't even sl...   \n",

For one it is on the border of Manhattan and East Harlem but has more of the Harlem feel.  The address we were given was incomplete and incorrect so I had to call several times and the owner's neighbor had to speak to my uber driver to get the proper address.   PHOTOS In the photos, the property is showed as being in a revived area with beautiful artwork on the street walls.  This wasn't our reality when we finally made it to the address and were met by the...   \n",

Maya was extremely gracious and helpful during my stay and kept the apartment in tiptop shape. So much has changed since I lived in the city in the 90s and Little Italy offers so much more than I would’ve imagined. The lower Eastside is a whole Nother world I wish I could explore more and that was also so very close as well.   \n",
