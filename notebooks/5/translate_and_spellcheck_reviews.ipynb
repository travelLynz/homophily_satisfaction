She is very considerate, specially she knows that I came to NYC all by my own so she showed me the neighbors around of the Apartment which it’s very easy way to get know there. she did everything to make me feel comfortable. The house is very clean and safe, the location is very great if you would love to enjoy the Central Park and the Met just a block away from it.

Everything was closeby (central park on short walking distance and express Subway just 4 blocks away). People on the block were really friendly, not overrun with tourists and had an authentic neighbourhood experience.   I heard no streetnoise in the apartment. Combined with the very comfy king bed I slept great.   I really wish I could stay longer, thanks Michelle!   \n",
